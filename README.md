## 🛠️ Projects & Research Work

Here are some key projects that reflect my ability to implement, explain, and build upon current academic research:

### 🚨 Fraud Detection Using Graph Neural Networks  
> Implemented based on the research paper:  
> *"X-FraudGNN: An Explainable Graph Neural Network Framework for Transaction Fraud Detection" (2023)*  
> [🔗 Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12345)  
> Built a full pipeline to classify fraudulent transactions using real-world-style graph data with visualization and evaluation metrics.

### 🎥 Deep Learning-Based Movie Recommendation System  
> A hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering using deep neural networks.

### 📄 Research Paper Replication  
> Reproduced and compared results from a top-tier conference paper (e.g., NeurIPS or ICML). Showcased performance improvements and implementation insights.
